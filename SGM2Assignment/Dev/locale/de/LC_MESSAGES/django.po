"Dublin  is the capital of and largest city in Ireland. Dublin is located in "
"the province of Leinster on the east coast of Ireland, at the mouth of the "
"River Liffey and bordered on the South by the Wicklow Mountains. The city "
"has an urban area population of 1,173,179. The population of the Dublin "
"Region, as of 2016, was 1,347,359 people, and the population of the Greater "
"Dublin area was 1,904,806. The name Dublin comes from the Irish word "
"Dubhlinn, from dubh 'pool', referring to a dark tidal pool. This tidal pool "
"was located where the River Poddle entered the Liffey, on the site of the "
"castle gardens at the rear of Dublin Castle."

"The Easter Rising of 1916, the Irish War of Independence, and the subsequent "
"Irish Civil War resulted in a significant amount of physical destruction in "
"central Dublin. The Government of the Irish Free State rebuilt the city "
"centre and located the new parliament, the Oireachtas, in Leinster House. "
"Dublin was also victim to the Northern Irish Troubles. During this 30 year "
"conflict, violence mainly engulfed Northern Ireland. However, the "
"Provisional IRA drew some support from within the Republic, including from "
"Dublin."

"A Loyalist paramilitary group, the Ulster Volunteer Force, bombed the city "
"during this time notably in an atrocity known as the Dublin and Monaghan "
"bombings in which 34 people died, mainly in Dublin itself. Since 1997, the "
"landscape of Dublin has changed. The city was at the forefront of Irelands "
"economic expansion during the Celtic Tiger period, with private sector and "
"state development of housing, transport and business. Following an economic "
"decline during the Great Recession, Dublin has rebounded and as of 2017 has "
"close to full employment."

"Similar to much of the rest of northwestern Europe, Dublin experiences a "
"maritime climate with cool summers, mild winters, and a lack of temperature "
"extremes. The average maximum January temperature is 8.8 C, while the "
"average maximum July temperature is 20.2 C. On average, the sunniest months "
"are May and June, while the wettest month is October. Rainfall is evenly "
"distributed throughout the year. Dublins sheltered location on the east "
"coast makes it the driest place in Ireland, receiving only about half the "
"rainfall of the west coast."

"Dublin has many landmarks and monuments dating back hundreds of years. One "
"of the oldest is Dublin Castle, which was first founded as a major defensive "
"work on the orders of Englands King John in 1204, shortly after the Norman "
"invasion of Ireland in 1169, when it was commanded that a castle be built "
"with strong walls and good ditches for the defence of the city, the "
"administration of justice, and the protection of the Kings treasure. One of "
"Dublins newest monuments is the Spire of Dublin, or officially titled "
"'Monument of Light'. It is a 121.2-metre (398 ft) conical spire made of "
"stainless steel and is located on OConnell Street. It replaces Nelsons "
"Pillar and is intended to mark Dublins place in the 21st century. The base "
"of the monument is lit and the top is illuminated to provide a beacon in the "
"night sky across the city. The Book of Kells, located in the library of "
"Trinity College, Dublin, is one of the citys most visited sites."

"The Book of Kells is an illustrated manuscript created by Irish monks circa "
"800 AD. The Ha penny Bridge, an iron footbridge over the River Liffey, is "
"one of the most photographed sights in Dublin and is considered to be one of "
"Dublins most iconic landmarks."
